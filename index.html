    <h3>A little bit about myself </h3>
    <p>I am a statistician/economist with one year working experience with a <strong>real</strong> passion for coding and art. When I’m not drawing, listening to music, reading a good book,playing an instrument, or blogging, i’m spending time with my pets.I first accessed a computer when i was seven and i remember not being able to contain my excitement.My love for computers kept growing as i interacted with them </p>
    <p>In both of my career fields,coding is a necessity in order to attain efficiency while working.During my first yearly break in university,i landed a two months' internship at a research and analytics firm where i was briefly introduced to computational statistics.i realised that the more i coded, the more i wanted to and the more i wondered what else i could be able to do with programming. I hoped that at some point in my life ,i would enroll to a school where i could learn to be a good software engineer. Being in Moringa school is a dream come true for me because i get to do this while being part of an amazing community.</p> </div>
    <p>Here is a list of some of the projects that i have created during my stay at Moringa school</p>
